    .SYNOPSIS
    Short function to validate email addresses using an API service at https://mailboxlayer.com
    The API (http://apilayer.net/api/check) validates email addresses based on format and tests
    to see if a valid domain.

    .DESCRIPTION
    Short function to validate email addresses using an API service at https://mailboxlayer.com

    Checks Email Address against API, returns details on email address validation and tests for
    "In Use" email addresses testing or if email address is disposable or if domain is valid

    Mailboxlayer offers a simple REST-based JSON API enabling you to thoroughly check and verify
    email addresses right at the point of entry into your system.

    In addition to checking the syntax, the actual existence of an email address using MX-Records
    and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), and detecting whether or not the requested
    mailbox is configured to catch all incoming mail traffic, the mailboxlayer API is linked
    to a number of regularly updated databases containing all available email providers, which
    simplifies the separation of disposable (e.g. "mailinator") and free email addresses (e.g.
    "gmail", "yahoo") from individual domains.

    Combined with typo checks, did-you-mean suggestions and a numeric score reflecting the quality
    of each email address, these structures will make it simple to automatically filter "real"
    customers from abusers and increase response and success rates of your email campaigns.
